Dear Editor: There is something to tell to you. I'm a middle school student.My name is Li Ming.Final exams are coming.Everyone is preparing for this.But there is some important problem during the review. Most of students often stay up late for the review.As the result,they always take a nap in the class and they can't keep the studying normal. I think we should be a reasonable time.The more relaxing we get,the better we will be.Brothers do not misuse wood workers I hope all the students can access to ideal scores. I'm expecting your answer and suggestion. Li Ming.
